# Database 1/4

## Topics Covered This Semester:
1. Data and Data Modeling;
2. Conceptual Model, Logical Model, and Physical Model;
3. Entity-Relationship Diagram;
4. Database Normalization;
5. NoSQL - MongoDB, MongoSH.


## Highlights

- Initially, the projects focused on modeling relational data systems using PostgreSQL.
- Based on these projects, more complex requirements were introduced, including modeling systems with multiple tables and additional constraints. Furthermore, normalization principles were applied.
- For the final projects, we utilized MongoDB, both with the Compass GUI and MongoSH, performing queries and enhancing our understanding of JSON/BSON.


1. **Data and Data Modeling**
   - This topic covers the fundamental concepts of data and its importance in various applications. It includes understanding the structure, types, and characteristics of data. The principles and practices of data modeling are introduced to represent and organize data efficiently for databases.

2. **Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Models**
   - This section explains the three main stages of database design: conceptual, logical, and physical. The conceptual model focuses on the high-level structure and meaning of the data. The logical model details the structure without considering the physical aspects, and the physical model deals with the actual implementation of the database on a specific platform.

3. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
   - ERDs are visual representations of the entities within a system and the relationships between them. This topic covers the creation and interpretation of ER diagrams, which are essential tools for designing databases and ensuring the accurate representation of data relationships.

4. **Database Normalization**
   - Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. This topic covers the various normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) and the rules for transforming a database schema into a normalized form. It ensures that the database is efficient and consistent.

5. **NoSQL - MongoDB, MongoSH**
   - This section introduces NoSQL databases, focusing on MongoDB, a popular document-oriented database. It covers the basics of MongoDB, including its data model, querying capabilities, and scalability features. Additionally, MongoSH, the interactive shell for MongoDB, is explored for executing commands and performing database operations.
